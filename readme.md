# redmine_user_default_group

To setup default group name go to Administration -> Plugins -> Redmine Default Group -> Configure

This plugin is based on the work of Arthur Zalevsky:
http://vsb.fbb.msu.ru/rhodecode/software/redmine_default_group

The main difference is that a new user always added to the default group and not only when
he signs in with LDAP.
